# PeekDemo
Coding challenge for Peek

This is a demo app I made as part of an application for work at Peek. The app loads a search timeline of all tweets mentioning the @peek account.

I used Fabric / TwitterKit to interface with Twitter, as it is the official API, and seemed the most polished of the methods I checked out. I used as many of the TweetKit classes and helper methods as possible, but ultimately rolled my own timeline view so I could better control behavior.
